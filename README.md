# docker-nginx-rproxy
Docker compose example using NGINX as a reverse proxy routing to an Angular app within a Docker NGINX container

## Running the application
You need to have docker, docker-compose installed to run the app.

Open a terminal and run the following command from the root directory.

>docker-compose up

This command may take a while on the initial run as it has to build the images etc.

Once the application is built and running, navigate to [http://localhost:8000] to see the sample Angular app.
